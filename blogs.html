          <p class="intro">
            I was doing level zero for NeoG.camp. In the second lesson, Tanay
            sir suggested something interesting named Hactoberfest. I had no
            idea what it was before. So I started googling around and landed on
            this website -
          </p>
          <div class="more">
            <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">"https://hacktoberfest.com/"</a
            ><br />
            <br />
            <h4>What Is This</h4>
            <p>
              I found it is an annual event by DigitalOcean which encounters
              people to contribute to other's open source repositories. It is a
              month-long event which occurs in October every year for the past
              nine years. Hacktoberfeat is the celebration and awareness of Open
              Source and giving it back. Hang on, What is Open Source, by the
              way? In simple terms, Open Source is any code or program that we
              can avail freely, modify and redistribute.
            </p>
            <h4>Eligibility</h4>
            <p>
              The best part is that you don't have to be an expert in anything
              to contribute. HacktoberFest welcomes people of any experience
              level and background to participate. Low-code, Non-Code,
              Technical, Non-technical, You may contribute anywhere.
            </p>
            <h4>What to do ?</h4>
            <h5>Short version</h5>
            <p>
              Register yourself on the Hacktoberfest website using a Github
              account and then have four pull/merge requests accepted between
              October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest.
            </p>
            <h5>Long version</h5>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  First, get familiar with some basics of GitHub and its
                  Repositories such as Owner, Author, contributor, ReadMe, Code
                  Of Conduct, Pull request, Issues, etc.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Filter and Find out a project where you can contribute
                  something. Within those projects, if you get an instinct that
                  something is wrong or could have been better, See whether you
                  can help.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If yes, then check out if it has a license. Next, check if the
                  Project actively accepts contributions or if your hard work
                  can go in vain. Check for the Issues and Pull Requests.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Open an issue to discuss a high-level topic or idea, report an
                  error, or propose a new feature.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Gather Context, Communicate with owners to get a clear picture
                  of the issue. Try to keep your requests short and Direct in
                  public chats.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Open a Pull Request--Steps-Clone the Repository->Fork->create
                  a branch->Edit your Solution->refrence any relevant
                  issue->test your changes->Push to the branch->Compare and Pull
                  Requests.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Great! After submitting, wait for the response. ->If you
                  haven't got one in a week, politely ask them in publicly.-> If
                  they request changes, do it if you can & resubmit -> If your
                  request is not accepted, make a classy move, respect their
                  decision, say thanks & move on.-> If your contribution gets
                  approved, Congratulations! Pat yourself on the back and keep

                  Many modern Technologies today rely on open source projects.
                  We often look into some other's source code to learn new
                  things or correct our programs, but we never thank or
                  acknowledge their hard work. This event is a way to make them
                  feel supported.
                </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>

              Hacktoberfest is an outstanding opportunity to acquaint yourself

              importantly, will positively impact your perspective for the rest
              of your life. Finally concluding with this Quote by Steve Goodier-
              <br />
              “ Money is not the only commodity that is fun to give. We can give
              time, we can give our expertise, we can give our love, or simply
              give a smile. What does that cost? The point is, none of us can
              ever run out of something worthwhile to give ".
